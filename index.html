      Hello, and welcome to my website. It's pretty plain right now, huh? Well that's becuase I've been spending more time learning than developing right now but don't you worry! 
      I'll be adding some style and interactions to to my site for you to enjoy. Until then, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilmorepreston/">LinedIn</a>.
